    A PDF portfolio can have a folder structure as you know from common package file formats (such as ZIP).<br/>
    This demo shows you how to create folders in a PDF portfolio (aka PDF package or PDF Collection).

    <b>Note:</b> The viewer application needs to support PDF packages. Otherwise you only see a simple empty page
    because this demo doesn't add any file to the portfolio.
