    A complete example of how to add a free text annotation to a digital signed PDF document.
</p>
<p>
    In this demo we also create the appearance of the free text annotation and calculate the correct coordinates
    based on the rotation and boundary box values of the page.

    Furthermore, we add some normally optional values to the annotation dictionary which are required by Acrobat if
    the document is e.g. digital signed afterward.
