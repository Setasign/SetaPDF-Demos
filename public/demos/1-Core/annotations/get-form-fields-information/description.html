<p>This demo iterates over all pages and their widget annotations (visible part of a form field in a PDF document).</p>
<p>
    It then simply dumps the raw data of the annotation. Keep in mind that e.g. coordinates are relative to the pages
    boundary box. So the information of the underlaying origin of the boundary box or page rotation isn't taken into
    account in these values.

    For fields which have a simple string value, the value is output, too.
