<p>
    This demo iterates over all pages and annotations (by default no form field / widget annotations) and flatten their appearance
    streams to the pages content stream. The annotations are deleted afterwards.

    If the <a href="https://setasign.com/formfiller" target="_blank">SetaPDF-FormFiller</a> component is installed it
    will also flatten form fields.
