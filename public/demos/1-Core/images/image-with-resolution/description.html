    This demo converts an image to a PDF document in a pre-defined resolution.

<p>
    You will not see the difference in the reader application because the pixel density isn't changed in any way.
    The difference can be seen in the page properties - at the end it is the page size that changes relatively to the
    given resolution (that bigger the resolution, that smaler the page size will be).
