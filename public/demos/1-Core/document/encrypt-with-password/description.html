<p>This demo applies a standard security handler (user and owner password) to an existing PDF document.</p>
<p>The user password is &quot;user&quot; and the owner password is &quot;owner&quot;.</p>
<p>
    It is up to the reader application to whether respect the defined permissions or not
    (not all viewer applications respect these flags).
