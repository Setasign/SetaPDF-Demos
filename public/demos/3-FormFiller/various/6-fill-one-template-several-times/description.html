    This demo shows you how to iterate over a bunch of data and fill a PDF form template several times. The template
    is a name badge including fields with a barcode font.

    The output is demoed through data URLs. A common workflow could be to concatenate the resulting PDFs to a single
    PDF file which is possible with the <a href="https://setasign.com/merger" target="_blank">SetaPDF-Merger</a>
    component.
