<p>
    The PDF format itself supports rich-text formatting for text fields while this is currently <b>not supported</b>
    by the SetaPDF-FormFiller component.
</p>
<p>
    But since version 2.41 SetaPDF comes with a
    <a href="https://manuals.setasign.com/api-reference/setapdf/c/setasign.SetaPDF2.Core.Text.RichTextBlock" target="_blank">rich-
        text block</a> class that allows you to write text that is formatted by simple HTML tags and a subset of CSS
    onto a canvas object. You can use this feature to create an individual field appearance which can be used and
    also be flattened.
</p>
<p>
    The PDF we use has also other fields for an individual header which are not filled in this demo (see
    <a href="/?p=%2Fdemo%2F3-FormFiller%2Fvarious%2F4-fill-field-with-image-or-pdf-page">here</a> for how
    you can fill these fields with e.g. images). For simplicity, we only fill the "Description" field
    in this demo.
