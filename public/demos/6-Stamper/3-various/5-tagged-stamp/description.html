<p>
    This demo uses a proxy stamp class which will enclose the stamps in marked-content sequences and
    add it to the documents structure tree.
</p>
<p>
    By default the new structure element is appended to the root node of the global tag structure.
    To add a stamp as a child of an existing structure element, make sure that it has an ID and
    pass this as the <code>$parentId</code> parameter of the constructor.
</p>
<p>
    If no individual tag should be created but the one that is resolved by the <code>$parentId</code> should be used, you
    have to set the tag-name to <i>null</i>: <code>$stamp->setTagName(null);</code><br />
    <b>NOTE: Such stamp can only appear on a single page!</b>
</p>
<p>
    You can also define an individual tag name, title, actual text, alternate text and the language.
</p>
<p>
    To demonstrate the usage of this class, we added an empty <code>Span</code>-tag to the document element
    structure of the PDF and set its ID to <code>date</code>. The demo than adds a text stamp directly into
    this prepared structure element.
