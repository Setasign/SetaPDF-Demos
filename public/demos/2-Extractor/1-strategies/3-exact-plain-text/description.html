<p>
    This demo shows you how to extract text using the
    <a href="https://manuals.setasign.com/setapdf-extractor-manual/strategies/exact-plain-text/" target="_blank">exact plain text</a>
    strategy.
</p>
<p>
    The main difference to the plain text strategy is, that this strategy extends the glpyh strategy, sorts them and
    recreates the text from this intermediate result while the plain text strategy uses the complete text which is
    invoked through a text output operator.
