    This demo shows you how to extract text using the
    <a href="https://manuals.setasign.com/setapdf-extractor-manual/strategies/exact-plain-text/" target="_blank">exact plain text</a>
    strategy.
</p>
<p>
    The main difference to the plain text strategy is, that this strategy splits all glyphs into individual glyphs
    including their positions, sorts them and recreates the text from this intermediate result.
