    If a filter is directly attached to a strategy each text-item will be checked against it and will exist only once
    in the result.<br/>
    If e.g. two rectangle filters are combine in a multifilter but share the same or overlapping area, only one
    instance will get the text-items. This can lead to unexpected results.

    This demo shows a way, to resolve all text-items once while filter them afterward several times to identify a
    document type. The rectangle filters use almost the same area.
