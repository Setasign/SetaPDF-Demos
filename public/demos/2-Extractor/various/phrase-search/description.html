<p>This demo shows you how you can search word phrases in a PDF document.</p>
<p>The single words are not compared to single search terms but the words are found by using regular expressions on the
    <a href="https://manuals.setasign.com/api-reference/setapdf/c/setasign.SetaPDF2.Extractor.Result.Words" target="_blank">words result</a>
    instance. The current regular expression matches parts and not whole words. The search term <code>&quot;word another thing&quot;</code> will
    e.g. end in following regular expression <code>&quot;/word\sanother\sthing/ui&quot;</code>.
</p>
<p>
    This logic is build into this demo. For sure you can use any regular expression in your own implementation.
</p>
<p>
    To keep text columns together and to support dehypen logic the
    <a href="https://manuals.setasign.com/setapdf-extractor-manual/strategies/word-group/" target="_blank">word group strategy</a>
    is used.
