    By default, the SetaPDF-Extractor component will extract all content on a pages content stream
    and the content which is positioned outside the visible area of a page. To give you some more control
    to this behavior you can pass a
    <a href="https://manuals.setasign.com/setapdf-core-manual/pages/page/#index-3">page boundary box</a> constant
    to the <code>\setasign\SetaPDF2\Extractor\Extractor::getResultByPageNumber()</code> method.

    This demo shows its behavior.
